# About the styleguide

Style guides require compliance and conformity; in return they provide stability and cohesion. A style guide and code standards document is a way of ensuring brand and code consistency. By maintaining all of a website's primary elements on a single page, we can see how modular components can be reused, as well as how changes to those elements will affect the site overall. The style guide also serves as a curated, archival collection for design and UX/UI decisions made during the course of the site's development - creating a code base that can resist arbitrary decisions since a predefined choice presents itself.
